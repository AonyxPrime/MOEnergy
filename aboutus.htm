				<h1>About Us</h1>
				
				<div>
				<p>Headquartered in the great city of St. Louis, MO Energy is the leading power supplier for the St. Louis region. Since our founding in 1912, MO Energy has always put our customer's needs first. We belive that everyone deserves equal access to electricity. This is why we have been consistantly ranked the number one utility company in the midwest by JD-Power five years in a row. 
				</p>
				<p>We are also rapidly expanding our renewable energy sources due to demand from our customers, as well as for the health of the planet. At MO Energy, we take Climate Change seriously; you and your children deserve a clean and healthy world!
				</p>
				<p>Take a look at the power plants that power your everyday life!

					<h1>Nuclear Power Plant</h1>
					<h2>Festus, Missouri</h2>
					<p>This is our only nuclear power plant. It was built in 1975, but is still one of the safest reactors in the United States with zero accidents. This single power plant generates around 22% of our total energy output. We at MO Energy are big promoters of nuclear power, especially as an answer to the growing threat of climate change. A lot of people are scared of nuclear power, but it is completely safe! Please request to schedule a tour through the "Contact Us" page if you are interested in learning more about our nuclear power plant and the ones we already planning to build in the 2020's and 2030's.
					</p>
					<p>With the invention of small scale nuclear reactors and thorium reactors, MO Energy can greatly decrease the timeline for becoming a the first carbon-neutral power company in the United States!
					</p>

					<h1>Natural Gas Power Plant</h1>
					<h2>Spanish Lake, Missouri</h2>
					<p>This is one of three natural gas power plants that MO Energy owns and operates. These power plants are a lot friendlier for the environment and produce a lot less pollution than coal fired power plants. Also, natural gas is more abundant and a lot cheaper than coal, so we can provide our customers with the best prices possible, even on those steamy summer days!
					</p>
					<p>MO Energy has made plans to phase out and decommission all of its natural gas power plants, in keeping with our promise to be more eco friendly. We have committed to shut down 2 of our 3 remaining natural gas power plants by 2028, with our third and last natural gas power plant currently being in the negotiation stages of decommission. 
					</p>
					
					<img src="Assets/Images/coal.jpg" alt="Coal Power Plant"/>
					<h1>Coal Power Plant</h1>
					<h2>Cedar Hill, Missouri</h2>
					<p>This is one of our oldest power plants, built in 1974, in Cedar Hill, Missouri. MO Energy used to own and operate over a dozen coal fired power plants, but over the past two decades, MO Power has taken steps to reduce its impact on climate change, and made the decision to eventually close all of its coal fired power plants. 
					</p>
					<p>We plan to phase out all of our coal plants by 2028 as we seek to build more renewable energy power plants. 
					</p>

					<h1>Wind Energy Farm</h1>
					<h2>Troy, Missouri</h2>
					<p>MO Energy owns and operates four wind turbine farms in the region, with each farm having around 150 wind turbines!
					</p>
					<p>With this large amount of wind energy, MO Energy is proud to offer its customers peace of mine know that 42% of their energy comes from green sources, with a large share coming from our wind farms. We are proud to be currently building our sixth wind farm outside of Wentzville, with expected opening date of mid 2023. 
					</p>

					<h1>Our Commitment to Solar</h1>
					<h2>St. Charles, Missouri</h2>
					<p>While MO Energy does not currently operate any Solar Power Plants, this does not mean that customers cannot install solar panels themselves. Each customer who installs solar panels for their home, business, apartment building, etc. will get a bill credit for 15% of the cost of installation. MO-Energy believes that by offing this generous program, we can help make Missouri a more green state. 
					</p>
					<p>Another bonus of installing solar panels is that they pay for themselves! Your electricity needs are first fulfilled by any energy that your solar panels produce. If you are producing an excess of energy, you can instantly sell it back to the grid! Customers who install solar panels, on average, make up for the cost of installation in just 7 years!
