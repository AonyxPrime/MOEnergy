				<h1>Help & FAQ</h1>
				<p>Below are many of our frequently asked questions. If you cannot find the answer you are looking for, please use our "Contact Us" page, located at the bottom of every webpage.</p>
				<p><strong class="question">Q: </strong> What should I do in the event of an emergency? </p>
				<p><strong class="answer">A: </strong> You should call either 911 or the relevant number for emergency services. Please DO NOT use our contact page for emergencies. If the emergency involved a downed electrical power line, please call emergency services first, and then you can contact us through our website. </p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong class="question">Q: </strong> Should I be worried if I live near a nuclear power plant?</p>
				<p><strong class="answer">A: </strong> No, you should not be worried. We have a perfect safety record when it comes to our nuclear power plant. Also, as scary as a nuclear meltdown might be, they are far too rare to be concerned about when compared to the lethality of pollution from fossil fuels. If you would like addition information about our nuclear power plant, please visit either our "About Us" page, or you can schedule a tour through our "Contact Us" webpage.</p>

				<p><strong class="question">Q: </strong> How often do blackouts occur? Should I invest in a backup generator?</p>
				<p><strong class="answer">A: </strong> While there are occasional isolated power outtages, there has not been a widescale blackout, in our power grid, since the 1990s. They occur roughly every 10-20 years, due to natural disasters. You should invest in a backup generator if you have equipment that must always be on.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong class="question">Q: </strong> Does MO Energy participate in fracking?</p>
				<p><strong class="answer">A: </strong> No, MO Energy has not, and will never participate in fracking. MO Energy may, however, get some amount of its natural gas from sources who use fracking, but we cannot be for certain. </p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong class="question">Q: </strong> Does MO Energy offer any scholorship opportunities for students going to college?</p>
				<p><strong class="answer">A: </strong> Yes! MO Energy does in fact offer scholorship opportunities for students seeking to go to college. We offer many scholorships though the Science Bowl competition, as well as through an application you can access by using our "Contact Us" web form. Since we started our scholorship programs in 2004, we have donated over $950,000 in scholorships to students!</p>
